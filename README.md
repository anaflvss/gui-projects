# gui-projects

This repo contains two little projects for practicing with GUI development. Both of them were built using the [PySimpleGUI](https://pysimplegui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) framework.

## Projects
1. **Guess the number**

 > A little game where the user tries to guess what number the program has selected. One can try as many times as they need to get it right. :)

2. **Translator** 
  
> This is my own version of Google Translate. It supports translations to many different languages thanks to the [googletrans api](https://py-googletrans.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), and is also possible to hear the correct pronounciation in both languages by clicking on the sound icon.
